# #set is a collection of non repititive elements
# Properties
#     Unordered which means that if you print s it can be printed in any order 
#     unindexed which means cannot access elements by indexed #print s[0] gives error
#     cannot change an elemnet

s={1,3,7,9,"o'r"}
print(s)
# NOTE:
# # is you say 
# s={} them python considers it as an empty dict not empty set
# s.add(45)
# s.add(1)
# print(len(s))#6 as 1 is already there so won't again add it in the set
# s.remove(3)#removes 3 from s
# print(s)
# print(s.pop())#removes a random element and returns that element
# print(s)
# s.clear() #clears all elements
# print(s) #o/p=set()
# print(s.intersection({1,4,8,3}))
# print(s.union({1,4,8,3}))
